				<h1>Febuary 12th, 2022</h1>
					<p>A student named [REDACTED] has sent a note to us to talk about their experience dealing with the PostyBears. The said quote:</p>
						<blockquote><q>Those damned spiders are ruining my school work! They always steal my papers and eat my lunch!</q></blockquote>
					<p>Another came up to one of our AELs, or one of the people who make these reports who goes to the school. They were in distress and with tears in their eyes, said this: </p>
						<blockquote><q>I just can't take it! One of those freaks BIT ME!</q></blockquote>
					<p>They then show a large, jagged hole in their shoulder which, oddly, was not bleeding. Could this be the start of a revolution? </p>
					<p>We decided it was best Mr.Post knows about his workers doing, so we set up a meeting. In this meeting we tell him the complaints and show him the bite. He listened with a pale face, amnd ran into a closet that has a man size hole with a ladder. He closed and locked the door, and we haven't heard from him in 4 hours. It is now 6 oâ€™clock. The doors are still closed and I fear we may be stuck.</p>
