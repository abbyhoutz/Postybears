		<h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
			<h2 class="disc">the events are not real. some of the people ,mentioned may be real or based of someone, but the way they act is fiction. 
			There is some content that may be triggering, such as non discriptive mentions of death, minor violence, and slight strong language, like the use of damn, hell ect.
			There will be no sexual content, as not only the creatures reproduce asexually, but many of the characters are minors, or are based off of minors aswell.
